For n=3, there a 8 processes in total (7 created.) However, for n=5, there are 32 processes in total (31 process created).
This is because the total number of processes, in the end, will be 2^n.
The reason for this is that after each fork, a new process is created which is in the state of being in the for loop that creates more forks.
So, after the first fork, for n=3, there will be two processes, both of which will fork two times more. So then these two processes become four processes, and these four processes will have to fork again.
So after each iteration, the number of processes doubles.
