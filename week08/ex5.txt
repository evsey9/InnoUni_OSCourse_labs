The physical address directly corresponds to the location in memory of an address, meaning that a certain physical address will always directly correspond to the same location in memory. However, programs cannot directly access physical addresses.
On the other hand, the virtual address is generated by the CPU and mapped to some physical addresses. What this means in practice is that for different programs, the same virtual address would point to different physical addresses.
Alongside that, program work only with virtual addresses instead of physical addresses, these virtual addresses serving as an abstraction layer and preventing programs from accessing the memory of other programs.
