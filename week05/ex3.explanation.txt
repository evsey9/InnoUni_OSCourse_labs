At first, upon changing m within the region from 1 to 4, the execution time was almost halved each time, with the performance gains dropping off the higher the number of threads became.
This can be explained by the fact that a processor with several cores can put a thread onto each core if there are not many threads.
However, if there are too many threads present, then each processor core would have to run many threads at once, which would not provide any significant performance improvement.
