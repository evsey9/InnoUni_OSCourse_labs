The Round-Robin algorithm shows worse average turn-around and waiting times than the first two algorithms, as it tries to be more "fair" by giving all the processes equal times to work, instead of trying to make assumptions about which process to run first. However, this does not inherently make it a worse algorithm, as in a system where the process running times are unknown, this algorithm would still work better than the First Come First Serve algorithm, preventing cases where a process with a very long running time is started first and doesn't let other shorter processes finish quickly.
